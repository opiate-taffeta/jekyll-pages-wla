<h2>About Us</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  Woodlake Academy is an independent secondary school committed to high standards of scholarship, citizenship, and personal responsibility.
</p>
<p>
  Through a rigorous liberal arts curriculum, extensive co-curricular program, and supportive residential environment, We encourage each student to develop an inquisitive and creative mind, sound body, and strong moral character.
</p>
<p>
  A vibrant, ethical community that embraces diversity, the Academy prepares students for leadership in a rapidly changing world that requires global understanding, environmental stewardship, and dedication to service.
</p>
<p>
  Our teachers work every day to model ways of thinking that are both independent and collaborative, and to remind our students that they matter. Together, they enthusiastically pursue goals, yet learn at every grade level to see beyond themselves by serving others, locally and worldwide.
