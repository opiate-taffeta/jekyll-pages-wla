## Full length programs page
Woodlake Academy offers its students a wide array of stimulating and challenging programs taught by passionate and dedicated faculty. Outstanding academic offerings are complemented by exemplary performing and fine arts curricula – taught by faculty who are professionals in their fields – and a full range of athletic teams and extracurricular activities.

As students enter our doors, we strive to know each child well and focus on helping them reach their potential. Whether in small groups throughout the day for reading and math instruction or working along side our engineering technology teachers in conjunction with classroom teachers, our children are provided innovative experiences as they explore and connect the disciplines.

### Technology
Our tools are temporary, our teaching is timeless. We don’t know exactly what tomorrow’s tools will look like, but we know they will continually change and we have faith in our teachers that they will sift the wheat from the chaff, that they will be flexible yet discerning in their methods, and that they will always preserve the essential teacher/student relationship. We use technology that provides the right tool at the right time, that is suited to individual student needs and that encourages students to be both connected and present.

### Traditions that Bind
Our strong community is forged, in part, through unique traditions, like our twice-yearly all-school weekends at a lakeside camp—the setting for some of our most vivid and lasting memories.

### Academics that Challenge and Excite
Catering to curious students who enjoy intellectual adventures in classes often taught at a college level, Our curriculum is rooted in analysis, discussion, inquiry, and writing.

### Walking in the Shoes of Others
Our travel programs offer students an opportunity to develop the skills and attitudes essential to global citizenship. By challenging students to consider new perspectives and different cultures, these trips seek to integrate education with the shifting realities of the wider world. Led by experienced faculty, these programs also allow students to deepen their relationships with the faculty leaders and their fellow travelers. Students return to campus with new perspectives and a broadened world view that prepares them for college and beyond.

### Giving Back
Students may volunteer to do community service as their afternoon co-curricular commitment, serving on-site at a service project four days per week. Students involved in the co-curricular community service program have worked at the local animal shelter, nearby farms, a variety of daycare and after-school programs, social service agencies, shelters, and nursing homes. Students also participate in on-campus projects.
